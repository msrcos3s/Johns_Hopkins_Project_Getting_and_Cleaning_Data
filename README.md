## Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Class Project

### Overview

This project is based in the Coursera Cleaning Data Course assignment.  

## Data Source

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

More information is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## The R run_analysis.R code in this repository primarily performs these 5 functions:
   
   1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
   2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
   4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
   5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
 ## Method:
 1. Downloading and cleaning the data.
 2. Data analysis.
 3. Testing ang training set.
 4. Tagging and merge.
 5. Extracting measurements.
 6. Saving the new Data.
